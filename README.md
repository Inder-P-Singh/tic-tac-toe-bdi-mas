Ticâ€‘Tacâ€‘Toe BDI Multiâ€‘Agent System (Perfect vs Random Agents): Demonstrates BDI architecture in Python + Matplotlib visualization
A Python implementation of a Beliefâ€‘Desireâ€‘Intention (BDI) Ticâ€‘Tacâ€‘Toe Multiâ€‘Agent System featuring:
- Perfectâ€‘play and Random-play agents
- Strategy based on classic perfectâ€‘play heuristics (Win, Block, Forkâ€¦)
- Visualization using Matplotlib and inline updates in Jupyter/Kaggle
- Demo agent scenarios â€” Random vs Random, Random vs Perfect, Perfect vs Perfect

ðŸ§  Architecture
- TicTacToeAgent: BDIâ€‘style agent with beliefs, ordered plans, and deliberate/act cycle.
- TicTacToeEnvironment: Runs turnâ€‘based games, updates agents, renders board + game stats.
- plans.py: Strategy functions implementing classic perfectâ€‘play logic.
